Hello world, welcome to my personal website and blog! Feel free to look around.

After months of working on this website in my free time, it's finally here. Let's have a look at how I built it and what to expect in the future.

### Tech details

The blog part of the website is built with [Jekyll][jekyll]{:target="_blank"}, a static site generator. That means no backend, no databases, no paying for hosting and no worries. Just text posts in markdown, templates in HTML/CSS and Liquid, all rendered by Jekyll and served by [GitHub Pages][gh-pages]{:target="_blank"}.

To bring out that "personal" part of the website, I used [Bulma][bulma]{:target="_blank"} CSS framework. Easy customization through Sass variables allowed me to set the colors, typefaces, etc. to create the look and feel that suits me. A typeface used for the headlines is [Space Grotesk][font]{:target="_blank"}, and icons were provided by [Iconify API][iconify]{:target="_blank"}.

Both responsiveness and accessibility were also considered while building the website. Although some features use JavaScript, the website works almost as good with JavaScript disabled. Each feature that relies on JavaScript has a fallback that should provide a similar UX to clients without JS.

### What to expect

I made this blog for practice, fun, and for documenting my learning process. I will write about whatever I find interesting and valuable, such as CTF writeups, my projects, learning experiences, hackathon experiences, challenges I have encountered, and so on.

When it comes to the posting frequency, there are many variables that could affect it. For now, I will just go with the flow. I would say I will post at least once a month — sometimes more, sometimes less.

If you use an RSS reader, you can add my [feed][feed] to not miss a post. If you have any questions for me, feel free to [contact me][contact].

Thank you for reading and have a great day.
